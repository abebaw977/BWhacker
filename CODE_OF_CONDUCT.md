# CONTACT 

## Purpose
This file explains how to contact the project maintainer, report security issues, or discuss contributions for the **BWhacker** repository.

---

## Project Maintainer
- **Name:** abebaw977
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/abebaw977
- **Preferred contact:** Open a GitHub Issue (label `support` or `question`) or open a Pull Request for suggested fixes.
- **Email (optional):** add-your-email@example.com  
  *(Replace the placeholder with a real address if you want email contact.)*

> Best way: create a GitHub Issue so the conversation is public, traceable, and linked to the repo.

## Security / Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security issue (vulnerability, data leak, or exploit) **do not post it publicly**. Follow responsible disclosure:

1. Open a private GitHub issue and mark it `security` (if repository settings allow), **or**
2. Send an email to the maintainer (use the email above) with:
   - A short summary of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce (commands, inputs, environment)
   - Proof-of-concept (PoC) code or screenshots (if safe)
   - Suggested remediation (optional)
3. Allow reasonable time for a response and for the maintainer to fix or mitigate the issue before public disclosure.

## Reporting abusive or policy-violating content
If you find content in this repo that violates law, privacy, or GitHub policies (malicious payloads, stolen data, doxxing):

- Create a GitHub issue titled `policy-violation` (if safe), or
- Contact GitHub Support directly: https://support.github.com/
- If immediate harm is likely, involve appropriate authorities.

---

## How to collaborate / Contributing
- Fork the repository → create a branch → submit a Pull Request (PR).
- For significant changes, open an Issue to discuss before coding.
- Use clear commit messages and add tests where possible.
- Label PRs `docs`, `bug`, `feature` as appropriate.

---

## Availability & Response time
- Maintainer checks GitHub periodically. Response time may vary.
- For security reports, expect an initial acknowledgement within 48–72 hours.

---

## Privacy & Data handling
- Do not send sensitive data (passwords, private keys) in public issues.
- If you must share sensitive proof, use encrypted email or a private issue.
- Any personal data received for security triage will be handled only to resolve the issue.
